            "content": "brand-new music, produced by Adrian Sherwood, by iconic Jamaican singer and frequent partner of Massive Attack, Horace Andy. By selecting a talented group of musicians and spending months honing performance, arrangements, and mixing, Midnight Rocker has been approached in a similar way to the late-career quality that Sherwood drew out of Lee 'Scratch' Perry with the Rainford and Heavy Rain albums. The end result is a stunning collection of songs that shine thanks to Horace's gorgeous vocals, excellent musicianship, and expertly constructed production. The majority of the songs are brand-new compositions with modern sentiments, such as 'Watch Over Them' and 'Materialist,' but the content also includes revisiting and updating a few classic Horace Andy tunes, such as 'Mr. Bassie.' 'Safe From' was also modified by the duo. Album release date April 8, 2022. The fourth studio album released by Puerto Rican rapper and vocalist Bad Bunny, whose stage name is 'A Summer Without You,' is titled Un Verano Sin Ti. After the release of his previous record El ltimo Tour Del Mundo, it was published on May 6, 2022 by Rimas Entertainment (2020). The album, which has twenty-three songs and features guest performances from Chencho Corleone, Jhay Cortez, Tony Dize, Rauw Alejandro, Bomba Estéreo, the Maras, and Buscabulla, is predominantly a reggaeton, cumbia, and indie pop record.",

In this example everything that can become a problem with the neck that inhibits the playability has happened except for a warped neck or anything that involves removing frets and/or major repair of the truss rod. If you have a warped neck or major truss rod repair, obtain a genuine replacement neck be it the neck alone or from a donor guitar with a thrashed body beyond restoration.Replace its tuners. What kind of tuners you purchase is entirely your choice and also how they are arranged. Les Paul and other similar headstock are called 3 x 3, three tuners on one side and three on the other and normally are in a different orientation than 6-in-line tuners on a Stratocaster type of headstock. In the event you have a different setup involving an uneven number of tuners, find that same exact set in the same orientation. You can also use in-line tuners but they will be left or right depending on how you play, but you are able to tune normally.",

            "content": "Gather your materials. Cleaning a guitar requires only a few materials. A soft cloth, like an old t-shirt or a sock, will do the job well, along with some water, glass cleaner, and a guitar polish that contains pure carnauba wax. An electric guitar can be cleaned in the same way as an acoustic. If you want to do a heavy duty cleaning on your guitar, you can use white distilled vinegar -- this is a safe product that won't damage the finish on your guitar. You should avoid most household cleaning products that contain silicone, heavy waxes, lacquer thinner, and bleach. All purpose cleaners and furniture polishes are also products you should avoid as they can damage the finish on your guitar. Avoid using paper towels to clean your guitar as they can scratch the guitar's finish, especially if it is a lacquer or shellac French polish. Using a cloth that has been laundered many times will work best because it should be mostly free of lint. Remove the strings. Before your begin the process of cleaning your guitar, it's a good idea to remove the strings so that cleaning your fretboard becomes an easier task. When you change your strings, that may be a good time to clean your guitar. Make sure you only remove a few strings at a time so that you don't mess with the neck tension on your guitar. It's important that you remove your strings on your guitar, because as you are cleaning the rest of the guitar you don't want any cleaning products to come into contact with your strings. Your strings should be free of any oils, polishes, or damp cloths that you may use while cleaning.",
